# Database Systems - Overview #
### *Homework* ###
----------
- What database models do you know?
	-	Hierarchical model
	-	Hierarchical key-value model
	-	Network model
	-	Relational (table) model
	-	Object model
	-	Document model
	-	Associative (Key-value) model
	-	Entity–relationship model
	-	etc ...
- Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
	-	Database management system is designed to manage a database.
	-	RDBMS Systems are very mature, rock solid.
	-	Using for management of relational data stored in tables.
	-	Definition of relational schema (database schema).
	-	Creating, modifying, deleting tables and relationships between them.
	-	Adding, modifying, deleting, searching and retrieving data stored in tables.
	-	SQL Language Support.
	-	Management (maintenance) of transactions.
- Define what is "*table*" in database terms.
	-	Table represents the structure the data will be stored. Table stores information organized in rows and columns.
	-	Row represents information about one record.
	-	Column represents a piece information / characteristic about certain record. Column has name and type.
- Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
	-	**Primary key** (Composite primary key) is a column(s) of the table that uniquely identifies the rows (records). Primary key is unique - meets only one time in certain column. 
	-	The purpose of **Foreign key** is to avoid data duplicates in table columns. The repeating data is separate in new table as each record has primary key used in the master table. Foreign key is not unique - can be used many times in certain column (usually number instead strings e.g.).
- Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
	-	*One-to-many* – e.g. country -> towns (Many towns in one country)
	-	*Many-to-many* – e.g. students <-> courses (Many students in many courses and conversely) - Implemented through additional table
	-	*One-to-one* – e.g. example human <- student (Using Inheritance)
	-	*Self-relationship* - e.g. 1. Root <- 2. Documents (ParentId: 1) <- 3. Pictures (1) <- 4. Birthday Party (3)
- When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
	-	Normalization removes repeating data from certain column or group of columns. 
	-	Separate repeating values from certain column to a new table (Master table) and replace old repeating values to Details table with their Primary keys from the Master table.
	-	Avoiding data duplication using unique data identifier (Primary key - usually number) from the new table (Master table).
- What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
	-	Ensure data integrity in the database tables    
	-	Enforce data rules which cannot be violated
	-	Used for *Primary key*:
		-	Ensures unique value for each table row
	-	Used for *Unique key*:
		-	Ensures that all values in a certain column are unique
	-	Used for *Foreign key*:
		-	Ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table
	-	Used for Check constraint (data restriction):
		-	Ensures that values in a certain column meet some predefined condition
- Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
	-	***Pros***:
		-	Faster lookup for results in certain column or group of columns (using index structures such as B-Trees or Hash Indexes to speed up searching of values). 
		-	Instead of scanning the entire table for the results.
	-	***Cons***: 
		-	Slower writes - adding / deleting records in indexed tables is slower.
		-	May cause the system to restructure the index of structure (Hash Index, B-Tree, etc), which can be very computationally expensive.
		-	Takes up more disk space - stores more data.
- What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
	-	**DDL** - Data Definition Language: 
		-	Creating, altering, deleting tables and other objects in the database.
	-	**DML** - Data Manipulation Language:
		-	Searching, retrieving, inserting, modifying and deleting table data (rows).
- What are transactions used for? Give an example.
	-	Used of competitive data access.
	-	Sequence of operations executing as a single unit.
	-	Can be rolled back if they are not completed properly.
- What is a **NoSQL** database?
	-	Use document-based model (non-relational)
	-	Data stored as documents
	-	Single entity (document) is a single record
	-	Documents do not have a fixed structure
-	Explain the classical *non-relational* data models.
	-	A non-relational database is a database that does not incorporate the table/key model that relational database management systems (RDBMS) promote.
	-	These kinds of databases require data manipulation techniques and processes designed to provide solutions to big data problems that big companies face. 
	-	The most popular emerging non-relational database is called NoSQL (Not Only SQL).
- Give few examples of **NoSQL** databases and their pros and cons.
	-	*Databases*:
		-	Cassandra (Distributed wide-column database)
		-	MongoDB (Mature and powerful JSON-Document database)
		-	CouchDB (JSON-based document database with REST API)
		-	Redis (Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server)
		-	H-Base
	-	*Models*: 
		-	Document model
		-	Associative (Key-value) model
		-	Hierarchical key-value model
		-	Wide-column model
		-	Object model
	-	*Pros*: 
		-	Support CRUD operations
		-	Support Indexing and querying
		-	Support concurrency and transactions
		-	Highly optimized for append / retrieve
		-	Great performance and scalability
	-	*Cons*:
		-	Difficult administration and support
		-	etc ...
